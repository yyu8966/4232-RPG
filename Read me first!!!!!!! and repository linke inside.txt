About the video, since it's an RPG so the video length will be long. 
So I used software for editing. The edited video will have a watermark. 
I will upload the unedited video along with the edited video.

There is also a deployed version of the game as well as an undeployed version within github. 
Due to issues with the game engine it may be difficult to view the code.
The deployed version of the game can be downloaded and played directly.

The cheat box will be moved to the town. in the deployed version.

Z is the OK button and X is the menu. arrow key control.
Again, you can use the mouse to operate, left click to determine and right click to return.
There are a series of quests at the tavern owner.
